       Task 01: Visualizing Data Distribution
       
            📄 Description
                        For this task, I was assigned to create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable. I chose                  to work with book publication data to demonstrate my ability to handle and visualize categorical data effectively.
                        
            📚 Dataset
                        Sample Dataset: I selected the Book Publish Data from Kaggle datasets. This dataset includes various details about books, including their                        publication dates.
                        
            📅 Categorical Data Selection
                        I chose the Publish Month column as the categorical data column to analyze the distribution of books published across different months.
                        
            🔍 Data Analysis in Excel
                       🔵 Count Calculation: Using the COUNTIF function in Excel, I calculated the number of books published in each month.
                       🔵 Visualization: I then created a 3-D bar chart in Excel to visualize this distribution clearly.
                       
            🛠️ Steps to Create the Chart
                       🔵 Data Import: Imported the book publish data into Excel.
                       🔵 Data Cleaning: Ensured the publish month column was correctly formatted and cleaned for accurate analysis.
                       🔵 Count Calculation: Applied the COUNTIF function to count the number of books for each month.
                                   🟡 Example formula: =COUNTIF(PublishMonthColumn, "January") for the month of January.
                       🔵 Chart Creation: Inserted a 3-D bar chart to visually represent the monthly book publication counts.
                       🔵 Chart Customization: Customized the chart with appropriate titles, axis labels, and colors to enhance readability and aesthetics.
                       
            📈 Output
                        The resulting 3-D bar chart effectively displays the distribution of book publications across different months. This visualization helps in                      understanding which months have higher or lower book publications, providing insights into publication trends.
                        
            🎯 Impact
                      🔵 Data Understanding: Improved understanding of data distribution and trends in book publishing.
                      🔵 Visualization Skills: Enhanced skills in creating and customizing charts in Excel.
                      🔵 Analytical Skills: Strengthened ability to analyze categorical data and derive meaningful insights.
